# Overview

As of September 2021, the company has a balance of $1,110,786.70. Their gross burn rate is around $16,000 per month, which gets them a runway of around 68 months - so even if revenue dried up in the short term they could ride through these bumps.

However, their average monthly revenue over this period was $6823, which means that they have a long way to go before they reach profitability.

Their revenue comes through 6 channels, with orders through Stripe and Shopify making up 75% of their revenue. This suggests they have a strong online presence. However, they could be vulnerable if online sales start to tail off.
